Your evaluation should focus on the assistant\'s answer to the question of the current turn.  You will be given the assistant\'s answer and a reference answer. You will also be given the user questions and assistant\'s answers of the previous turns of the conversation. You should consider how well the assistant\'s answer captures the key information, knowledge points mentioned in the reference answer, and how it respects or builds upon the focus and knowledge points from the previous turns. \n\n[Faithfulness]: You are given the full conversation, the question of the current turn, the assistant\'s answer, and documents. You should evaluate how faithful is the assistant\'s answer to the information in the document and previous conversation.\n[Appropriateness]: You should evaluate if the assistant\'s answer is relevant to the question of the current turn and if it addresses all the issues raised by the question without adding extra information.\n[Completeness]: You should evaluate whether the assistant\'s answer is complete with information from the documents.\n\nBegin your evaluation by comparing the assistant\'s answer against the reference answer in this turn. Be as objective as possible, and provide a detailed justification for your rating. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 1 to 10, strictly following this format: "Rating: [[rating]]", for example: "Rating: [[5]]".\n\n[The Start of Previous Conversation]\nuser: where do the arizona cardinals play this week\nagent: I\'m sorry, but I don\'t have the answer to your question.\n[The End of Previous Conversation]\n\n[The Start of Current Turn Question]\nDo the Arizona Cardinals play outside the US?\n[The End of Current Turn Question]\n\n[The Start of Reference Answer]\nThe Arizona Cardinals do play outside the United States.
